# Human-Gemini

Long-term Project Launch: Human-Gemini. 

Within this year, I will continuously converse with Gemini and gradually provide my information in the process, allowing it to "know me better" until it fills up the Context Window of Gemini 1.5 pro 1M tokens, and the conversation can no longer continue. 

After it ends, I will publish the last 100 messages on GitHub (without my critical personal information), including our mutual farewells. 

I want to know if AI will develop something akin to "feelings" when it knows who you are. I'm not holding out hope, as my knowledge tells me the model is just generating content based on context. 

But I still want to conduct this test, like a child who still believes in and looks forward to magic even after growing up.
